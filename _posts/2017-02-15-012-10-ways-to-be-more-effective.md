In this episode Thanasis and Dimitri talk about how to be more effective at your work.

## Transcript

**Dimitri** [00:00:04]: Are you an entrepreneur, a designer, a developer. Never before has it been easier to get your new venture off the ground whether you're just getting started or you have already begun your journey, you've come to the right place. In each episode we will dive into a new challenge breaking it down into simple digestible terms. I'm Dimitri.

**Thanasis** [00:00:19]: And I'm Thanasis.

**Dimitri** [00:00:19]: And you're listening to Listen to listen Ship repeat, episode 12, "10 ways to be more effective". Hello there Thanasis!

**Thanasis** [00:00:44]: Hello, what's up!

**Dimitri** [00:00:44]: I have a book recommendation. "Will it fly?", I think it's relevant to our podcast, too. It's about, if you want to start a business on the internet or not, how to test your idea. Market fit, has a few exercises.

**Thanasis** [00:01:06]: What's the name?

**Dimitri** [00:01:07]: "Will it fly‚Äù.

**Thanasis** [00:01:09]: By whom?

**Dimitri** [00:01:10]: By Pat Flynn.

**Thanasis** [00:01:12]: Oh, I know him.

**Dimitri** [00:01:12]: You do? Alright. So maybe we'll put a link or something in the show notes. So it's a very short read. You can you can read it in a few hours. I read it in the weekend but, I could have read it in one sitting and it just takes you through the stages of conception validation, market fit. It's done in that context, will it fly, like paper airplane sort of metaphor. Very uplifting style of writing too. It reinforces that. You're doing great in every paragraph.

**Thanasis** [00:01:56]: That's good, that's good.

**Dimitri** [00:01:57]: Yeah. So what are we talking about today?

**Thanasis** [00:02:00]: Today we're talking about being more effective, producing more in the same time span and eventually never missing your deadlines.

**Dimitri** [00:02:11]: Do know that Douglas Adams quote? "I like the sound that deadlines make as they whoosh by"?

**Thanasis** [00:02:21]: I got a lot to say about this but I want to say it at the end.

**Dimitri** [00:02:26]: Okay. So being more effective, missing deadlines. What would you say for your experience, for you personally. What do you miss your deadlines?

**Thanasis** [00:02:39]: Well, yeah there are many reasons, we're going to get them one by one. But one of the reasons that have a negative impact on your workflow is have to do either with your, you know, mental situation at the moment in your environment. So if procrastination is a thing for you that happens too often then, you know that's number one. Of course procrastination isn't a character trait, rather it's an interesting measure. If you're not interested in your job you're looking to procrastinate. So it's a consequence.

**Dimitri** [00:03:25]: Another thing could be, the rolls within the organization having no accountability and I think that's simply as saying that it kind of get rid of a motive you might have to stay on track.

**Thanasis** [00:03:40]: Yeah. Well motive and accountability, similar overlapped, but not the same. And the environment then, a bad environment doesn't really inspire you to be productive.

**Dimitri** [00:03:59]: I think that's the lowest hanging fruit that you can actually get rid of, the bad environment, it's completely in your control.

**Thanasis** [00:04:07]: I'd say we turn onto the positive ones, what you should do.

**Dimitri** [00:04:11]: Okay. Also let's not forget poor planning to, like the master of not missing, not reaching deadlines. Now I think it's worth mentioning that we'll talk about a lot of stuff in previous episodes about project management planning methodologies. Today I think we'll be talking more about what you can do as a person, what soft skills you can deploy in order for you to be more effective and my favorite and what I do, I start my day every single day, at the same time. And that's how I operate as a person. If I had my ducks lined up in a row and I know that in advance it really helps me be productive.

**Thanasis** [00:05:10]: How long have you been doing that, Dimitri?

**Dimitri** [00:05:13]: For as long as I can remember.

**Thanasis** [00:05:16]: Alright. It wasn't because you had a family?

**Dimitri** [00:05:19]: No, no. It was as long as I can remember. When I say that you know, realistically, definitely the past 10 years or so. There was a time that I wasn't doing that in a time, but I find it to be an easy item on the checklist to be more effective. You start at a time, maybe if you can, but that's not guaranteed finish at the same time and time blocks your daily activities.

**Thanasis** [00:05:48]: Right right. I can understand how this is very important. However, for me personally I find it hard to retain a very steady schedule. In rough limes it is the same, but definitely don't start at the same time every day. But I can see how this can be critical. Because a routine is a integral part of you being efficient. Right. So, the next thing that you can do in order to be more efficient is a very obvious thing. Don't get distracted. And don't get distracted doesn't simply mean that you communicate with your team and your surroundings. It starts with you and the way that you set up your mobile phone, tells a lot about how much you want to be distracted or not.

**Dimitri** [00:06:46]: So what's your profile that you've set up?

**Thanasis** [00:06:49]: The only reason why my phone rings is because they're calling me or a message has come, Meaning an SMS message, you know, nothing else. No messenger, no e-mail popping up on the screen. Nothing.

**Dimitri** [00:07:09]: I see, so no email, slack notifications.

**Thanasis** [00:07:12]: Nothing.

**Dimitri** [00:07:14]: Do you have an android or an iPhone?

**Thanasis** [00:07:17]: I have an iPhone.

**Dimitri** [00:07:18]: Okay, you know you can you can set it on don't disturb period and I think on Android, it's much more fine grained, you can do that as well. But you know I respect that.

**Thanasis** [00:07:31]: I'm very fanatical with that. I really don't care. I mean everything that's supposed to distract and stop my whatever I'm doing right then, it's not worth it. Everything that happens has a notification in the mobile device is a synchronous communication. If it is synchronous which means that you need to be right there, that means that somebody is calling you.

**Dimitri** [00:07:55]: Okay. So you've set up a situation in your team where if there's an emergency they can call you basically.

**Thanasis** [00:08:01]: Yeah definitely. I mean if it's an emergency people call people, they don't start messaging, "Hey are you there.

**Dimitri** [00:08:08]: Well I see what you're saying. Even in the pre Slack era, people were using Skype. It really depends on the organization. I can't say I'm terribly crazy about having a 24/7 notification or Slack presence. But I noticed that when it was a new technology and people first started using it, there was actually little respect for boundaries. But I found that those times moved on, these time boundaries have been respected, at least the teams that I've been lucky enough to be part of.

**Thanasis** [00:08:53]: Right. Let's move into the most important stuff in terms of distracting, right? Now you're in the office, a lot of your colleagues around, your CTO, your CEO. Everybody understands that when you distract the programmer for even just an instance, you break all their line of thought and that line of thought in order to be rebuilt requires 30 to 60 minutes.

**Dimitri** [00:09:21]: You take them out of the zone basically.

**Thanasis** [00:09:22]: Exactly. There's a very good diagram describing that, I'll put it in the show notes. So the idea is that you are at the efficiency level ten and a five minute meeting takes place, your efficiency drops to zero, stays to zero for the duration of the meeting and when it's done you have a very slow and gradual ramp up to 10 minutes within a span of an hour.

**Dimitri** [00:09:51]: Looks like you've really fine tuned this.

**Thanasis** [00:09:54]: I mean that's something that every manager should keep in their minds. You know, that five minute meeting, really disrupts a whole hour of the developer and there aren't so many hours in a day.

**Dimitri** [00:10:07]: Well, let's talk about tasks. In my case and in this reality we live in, it's the most expensive thing in the world to do multiple things. You know people say, can you do multiple things at once, can you juggle multiple projects. I would twick that a bit and say that I am perfectly ok with doing, as I do and I'm sure you do, multiple tasks per day. However I'm very specific about doing a single task at a time. What does that mean? I don't have four hands, of course you are gonna do the single task at a time, but to put it like as an example, I won't have two tabs open or I won't have two IDs open on a virtual screen. I'm trying to be always focused on one task at a time. Within the context of my planning throughout the day, I'll be able to be productive on several things, no doubt.

**Thanasis** [00:11:04]: Yeah definitely. I mean I think we are past you the era where we were thinking of multitasking and thinking that that's a very advanced skill and people doing what multitasking are like, you know, wow. I think we are way past that and we are leaning towards you know, one task at a time, stay focused on that and that is especially true again for engineers and developers. I mean if you're like an administrator or in an administrative position. Yeah, naturally your your work is chaotic and that is what you're supposed to do. But if you're a productivity unit, you've an engineer or a programmer, one thing at a time is the only way.

**Dimitri** [00:11:59]: Now, what's next?

**Thanasis** [00:12:03]: Well, next number four. Apply the right amount of pressure and the right amount of pressure. There have been studies in terms of how much stress reduces or raises the productivity of people and what they've found is that. There is an ideal amount of stress that maximizes production and productivity. But the moment you surpass that level of stress of applying more pressure to the person, the performance drops dramatically.

**Dimitri** [00:12:48]: So it's the straw that breaks the camel's back?

**Thanasis** [00:12:51]: Yeah. So there is the sweet spot of applying pressure, like you, know let's say a 30 percent, let's call it like that, that does wonders. But if you go at 37, 40 percent you break the deal.

**Dimitri** [00:13:07]: And that applies to yourself and your team too.

**Thanasis** [00:13:12]: Yeah, that is a general rule. And for every person this index of 30 percent is different you know, mine is a little bit higher, I work better under stress. Other people work better under lower stress, but having some stress there, some pressure applied makes things better.

**Dimitri** [00:13:32]: Where is this 30 percent figure came from?

**Thanasis** [00:13:36]: It's totally made up.

**Dimitri** [00:13:41]: Maybe we can cite something that we can put in the show notes.

**Thanasis** [00:13:45]: There is something, there are diagrams and out of my mind I remember that at 30 percent you know, it was like one third of the way that you had the best performance.

**Dimitri** [00:13:58]: How would you measure this? Because he's trying to trial and error I suppose, there's a new team member..

**Thanasis** [00:14:06]: Well it's a whole research. How they did it, the methodology and stuff, I didn't dig that deep. Is that what you're asking?

**Dimitri** [00:14:15]: I'm just thinking out loud.

**Thanasis** [00:14:17]: Alright.

**Dimitri** [00:14:20]: No, that's fine.

**Thanasis** [00:14:21]: Did that surprise you?

**Dimitri** [00:14:23]: No no. Let's move on. One of my favorites would be having realistic expectations. So I'd like to talk about this a bit with you. So, we're talking about being more efficient today and having deadlines. So, I was interested what you said before about this 30 percent figure, I'd like to apply maybe a similar logic to deadlines and making sure that these deadlines are realistic. Now, unfortunately or fortunately enough if you if you've been in this business, my setting deadlines comes with experience obviously. So as you grow, you will be able to fine tune that. But in my situation is to the best of my ability, when setting a deadline, initially I will always be quite realistic and I'll let a 10 percent, maybe 20 percent time after that just for the heck of it. And I'll tell you what, sometimes I might not even make that. So it's a very interesting philosophical discussion. Have you heard of, I think it's called Hofstadter's law. It's one of those Murphy's Law type of things. It's not on the top of my head, so if I'll be corrected by somebody, but it's like, a project might always take longer to plan. Even if you take Hofstadter's law into account.

**Thanasis** [00:16:06]: Alright.

**Dimitri** [00:16:07]: Now that didn't sound good. I'm googling it. It's a self referential time related at the age coined by Douglas Hofstadter and it says, it always take longer than you expect even when you take into account Hofstadter's law and that's Hofstadter's law. So you make a deadline. It's 10 percent. You might overrun 10 percent, if you said 20 percent you might overrun the 20 percent, so it's a bit tricky and that's all I have say. You didn't get too excited. Usually it raises an "Oh, ok", mind blown sort of reaction, when you first mentioned that law.

**Thanasis** [00:16:49]: Right. So setting realistic expectations is the foundation of not getting disappointed, because if your expectations are set straight there is no problem, if it isn't, that's where the problems starts. The thing that you should try to figure out is missteps. Is it the administration that has too high expectations, or the production that underdelivers. That is a tough one, because whenever you are called upon judging that, you're primarily on the administrative side, you know, as the CEO, the founder. It's difficult to judge yourself, having very high expectations. I think we should dedicate a whole episode on that subject.

**Dimitri** [00:17:44]: I think so too because, realistic expectations, as a matter of fact it's an entire life chapter, isn't it? It's not just like, setting up a startup. I've noticed in my day to day life it's a trait people have you know, some people really get disappointed if their expectations aren't met and these expectations can be so insignificant, it's amazing. So maybe we can gather some research and we'll do an episode on that.

**Thanasis** [00:18:29]: Managing expectations!

**Dimitri** [00:18:32]: Managing expectations. Dealing with you know, addressing and dealing with expectations that haven't been met. That's definitely something we can cover.

**Thanasis** [00:18:42]: Dealing with an underperforming team.

**Dimitri** [00:18:45]: So there you have it. Stay tuned.

**Thanasis** [00:18:48]: Right. So, the next thing is to use proper channels of communication. Now, as a remote worker, I've been working remote for over four or five years now. This has been a very important thing in communicating. Before I communicate anything with anybody, I stop and think for a few seconds, what would be the best way to communicate what I want to communicate. So, there are casual chat things that are going on on your general Chanel or water cooler or in real life in the same climate. But then there are operational operational information that needs to be communicated and that's when you should be careful and put that information where it belongs. So, if that information is part of a task that is in progress the information belongs to your project management tool. So, that is Trello, it's Trello, you know.

**Dimitri** [00:19:55]: It's probably Trello.

**Thanasis** [00:19:55]: Yeah we don't use Trello in my current company. So, using the proper communications channels is paramount. And especially with slack, this has been a little, you know, it has kind of steered the waters of communication and it's very important to understand when to write something on slack, when to ping somebody. You know mention them, Send them a private message. Is it worth a private message? Maybe this question could be answered by another member, it's not just because you know something better. If you have a private question shared with a team, so that the answer also goes back to the team, right? If you send me private messages, you pull me out of what I'm doing right then and then. What I like to do in Slack, so let's say I have something really significant, I like to go in general and say @everyone. Which I don't do. Well you know, we're on this Slack community and somebody jumped in a while back and we had to disable everyone. Cause it was fine because it was Saturday morning. It was like something off topic too. It was weird. Maybe they hadn't used Slack before or maybe they didn't have the concept. I mean in an enterprise Slack, you know in a company in a business Slack.

**Dimitri** [00:21:41]: Well the way we do it in my current team, so PMing people is discouraged if it's for like, operation related stuff. Ping me and we can share cat gifs 24/7, no worries. It's a transparent ideology, if you want to call it, because it's really that ingrained that everything is on the public channels, because if you and Joe have an issue, but it's on part of the status that's unrelated to me, I'll just absorb that and at some point in time when it comes to me I will say OK Thanasis and Joe talked about that.So that's like the simplest example. But in general it's nice to also give, because it's a remote team and it's nice to be able to be part of something too, instead of like being shut up in a box and just communicate.

**Thanasis** [00:22:45]: Yeah definitely. I mean there are the social moments and then there are the moments where you do your job and you know choosing the right medium goes both ways. So it goes on the way of being silent and discrete, you know putting a comment inside Trello that's important to your story. It also goes the other way, where something important, you know, like last year we had an emergency and the people who were trying to reach me through Slack. Now that's, I mean pick up the phone and call. It didn't go well at all. After many hours I fixed it.

**Dimitri** [00:23:29]: Sorry, many hours of trying to reach you or many hours of fixing?

**Thanasis** [00:23:32]: Many hours of trying to reach me and they didn't manage to reach me because I just logged in to Slack and saw the messages. I mean pick up the phone, if it's an emergency, pick up the phone.

**Dimitri** [00:23:42]: Was it one of those messages, because it took you a long time was like the first message "Hello". The second message "hello again". And you get up to the tenth message like screaming and loud.

**Thanasis** [00:23:52]: You know, "The server is burning‚Äù.

**Dimitri** [00:23:55]: There was an episode of Seinfeld TV show where George was leaving messages on an answering machine because it was the 90s and she wasn't getting back to him and the final message was like completely psycho. And eventually she called and said, "Oh, I've been away a few days, I'm going to go back and check my messages". So that was the whole thing that had to go back to the apartment get in and steal the tape. Sorry about that. It's like the message is not generated. On top of this for the Slack culture thing too, you can set up like random channels and have them completely silenced where you share music and stuff and then it's like up to you when you enter the channels and interact in a non work led way with your team, too.

**Thanasis** [00:24:49]: Right.

**Dimitri** [00:24:50]: I think that could make you more efficient because you know, all work and no play.

**Thanasis** [00:24:54]: What's next.

**Dimitri** [00:24:56]: Never wait until the last minute. So yeah, I mean can we move on to the next chapter. No seriously though, if you see some things about to happen or you can foresee stuff that's about to happen, your database is swelling and it might create performance issues down the line. Don't wait for them to happen. Identify them and policies that you always have to be vigilant. Never wait till the last minute because, then you won't be able to get in touch with the people. Emergencies usually take longer to fix and especially my favorite part, because you know I'm a methodology sort of enthusiast, integrate this into your flow as tasks to deal with them sooner than later.

**Thanasis** [00:25:50]: And you were the one that said refactoring is now right?

**Dimitri** [00:25:53]: Yes.

**Thanasis** [00:25:55]: I have a story about that.

**Dimitri** [00:25:56]: Really?

**Thanasis** [00:25:57]: Yeah a recent one because.

**Dimitri** [00:26:00]: Where they didn't refactor now and everything broke?

**Thanasis** [00:26:01]: No no, exactly the opposite and that made and impression on me and I remembered your words.

**Dimitri** [00:26:07]: Oh really. So yes it happened to you. Like in a good way, like you're not disagreeing with me, right? Sweet!

**Thanasis** [00:26:15]: So the idea was that, I made a suggestion for a big change on the code base, like really big, you know, in javascript you may write, let's say today's javascript or you may write tomorrow's javascript, but through an interpreter that interprets and transforms the language into today. What I basically suggested is that we let go off that interpreter and I suggest that for a very large codebase a very mature, being developed for over a year and I got really surprised because the CTO really agreed with that and then he sat during the weekend and then he did that refactoring without me knowing it, I realized it afterwards. I was like wow, that is refactoring now.

**Dimitri** [00:27:10]: I got to the situations were like at the moment unfortunately I'm rebuilding something, but I don't know if it could have been under the refactoring is now sort of thing. I'll get back to you soon on that but we had this component that we were adding layer on top of layer on top of layer. In the end it got to a point where you couldn't actually realistically plan for the fifth step when you were in the first. So now we're kind of rebuilding that. It's no big deal time wise. But, I think that falls under the don't wait till last minute, good planning.

**Thanasis** [00:28:02]: Right, right.

**Dimitri** [00:28:04]: I try to eat my own dog food, but it's actually very puzzling for you to hear. It's one of those things.

**Thanasis** [00:28:16]: And you know what? When I asked him about that, that's exactly what he told me in different words. I mean he doesn't want to leave for later on what must be done today, because things get to pile up on it and then refactoring is harder down the road.

**Dimitri** [00:28:32]: That's what it really is. But because of vanity I really wanted to give it a sentence that supposedly I came up with. But, really what it is, it's like don't procrastinate.

**Thanasis** [00:28:42]: Yeah. So the next thing is to communicate progress every day. Why why is this important?

**Dimitri** [00:28:50]: Saving the best for last sort of thing. We had to get up to a point number eight to bring out the good stuff here.

**Thanasis** [00:28:59]: Yeah I guess.

**Dimitri** [00:28:59]: I find communication be the cornerstone of everything. That's how stuff works, like the giants have crumbled because communication was poor and organizations were opaque and they didn't communicate thoroughly between them. I'm just going to bring up the business case like I was listening to one of these BBC podcasts this week that I listen to about Real Madrid and at some point the miscommunication within the organisation like in previous decades 70s or 80s was so bad, that they had no financial issue but with what was happening, they almost went bankrupt back in the 80s. The new president the came onboard instituted communication and transparency vertically through the organization. So, here's a single use case that I can come up with in a non-technical field too because I just want to stress out how important it is in business and in an industry in general. I encourage that, openness is good openness great. So, specific stuff you want to look into in order to communicate progress. So if you want to be completely open that's up to you, if you want to test the waters first and see that as a goal you want to reach, that's fine too. I would recommend having the daily stand up which is part of many methodologies out there, but also don't let that inhibit you in any way, distract you from using it. You can have a daily stand up regardless of what methodology you're using or not. Get together for 10 minutes. Everybody has a turn. Five minute time boxed sessions every single day. The every single day is important here. Like, if you do it one day, don't say the next day, look I really have nothing to say. You know you probably have a lot to say because you were at your desk or on the field for a work day. So, what you did yesterday, what you doing today, identify blocking issues, sharing information and repeat.

**Thanasis** [00:31:20]: Yeah, definitely. I mean it's not few times even in the very recent past that the same job was performed by two different people or the job that you performed, the plan really didn't need that job because there was a bad communication or even a misunderstanding on the spec. Those are very critical stuff and you can lose days.

**Dimitri** [00:31:50]: Yeah. It's actually interesting point you bring up misunderstanding of the spec. I think a daily stand up routine would get that out fairly quickly. Because they'll be saying "what did you do yesterday? I did this". Okay, again "what did you do yesterday? I did this" on the second day. Wait a sec. We kind of said that, etc.

**Thanasis** [00:32:13]: Right. And communication is a skill that you evolve throughout your lifetime. I mean it's still the biggest pain point in efficiency, I believe. At least for me. Now, next thing, number nine is to eat rest and recharge your body and soul. So, don't overdo it because, there is an efficiency line here. The more you work doesn't mean that you are producing more, so if you can retain six hours of super productivity per day, that would be awesome.

**Dimitri** [00:32:58]: That's crazy achievable too.

**Thanasis** [00:33:02]: Yeah. I mean it's achievable, it's way better than say, I worked for 16 hours.

**Dimitri** [00:33:07]: Now we are not the healthiest people that exists, but like, I found that when I decided to take care of my diet a bit more, because I just wanted to start being a healthy person basically and resting more and riding my bike every day. I saw and I felt the gains.

**Thanasis** [00:33:34]: Exercise gives you more energy.

**Dimitri** [00:33:40]: Rest, thankfully I've been taking that seriously for years now.

**Thanasis** [00:33:45]: Seven hours of sleep definitely every night and rest on the weekends too. Like on the weekends, I tend to look at some of my personal stuff now and again, like person projects. But Sunday in particular it's more like you know, reading spend time with family. Maybe some planning for the week ahead but just keep it to a minimum and just bounced back on Monday for the coming week. And the next item, the final one, is "Do you have bad news? Share them". If something bad is going on, something wrong with something, if you keep it inside you it's only going to get magnified and nothing is going to happen.

**Dimitri** [00:34:35]: Share it. Nobody is going to say something about you. Don't let it bubble up. If you've made a mistake. Share it. You'll fix it. Two heads are better than one and you've communicated it and it will work out. As a matter of fact, remember that Gitlab situation a few weeks back? I think it's been a couple of weeks.

**Dimitri** [00:35:05]: So you know they had a lifestream set up.

**Thanasis** [00:35:09]: Yes. And it was amazing.

**Dimitri** [00:35:12]: We learned that in the YouTube description there were like, updating and at some point people in the comments we're getting.

**Thanasis** [00:35:20]: Just to bring our listeners up to speed after Gitlab suffered a catastrophic failure on their database and they had to stay down for almost a day. They started a live stream on YouTube with their efforts to restore their service. That stream went on for hours and hours and hours.

**Dimitri** [00:35:44]: So for some reason people saying oh who's going to get fired for this and they actually address that and said like, nobody is going to get fired. Mistakes happen. So, it turns out it probably wasn't honest mistake internally. That stuff happened and like you know mistakes happen and I'm going to keep that in mind from now on. Even that level of bad stuff, you know you do your retrospective, you see what happened and all I'm saying is that like I'm just giving you the worst case scenario if something bad happened, incompetency happened, you still have to show it immediately. Don't worry about it.

**Thanasis** [00:36:29]: And this goes for multiple levels as well. So, you know even if it's a personal issue, share it with your close friend. If it is within a team, share with your team. If it's something that's happening on your life share with the world. Write a blog post. So there are multiple ways and the multiple levels on how you can do that.

Dimitri[00:36:51]: Right.

**Thanasis** [00:36:54]: So, some general remarks on the subject of efficiency and deadlines. You know, our original title was, you remember 10 ways to achieve your deadlines, something like that and the reason why..

**Dimitri** [00:37:12]: I'm sorry can I interrupt you? The original, original title was "On deadlines and plans". Exciting exciting stuff right?

**Thanasis** [00:37:23]: And you know my primary motivation on when to change the title was that deadlines are a little bit over used today and in a typical Web business, you wouldn't have more than like, I don't know, 10 deadlines per year. And that's even a big number. I mean web business what are your deadlines, right? Your lunch date, is not a deadline. You will launch whenever you're ready.

**Dimitri** [00:37:56]: Yes. And they're kind of irrelevant.

**Thanasis** [00:38:00]: Exactly. The only deadlines that I can see are, events, exhibitions going on and you need to be ready by then.

**Dimitri** [00:38:12]: Yes some trade show is something that you want to present, like some investor meeting.

**Thanasis** [00:38:16]: Yeah right!

**Dimitri** [00:38:18]: And this comes from the realization that it is more important to focus on team throughput. Versus the tasks themselves and the deadlines. So if you focus on a team that has a very high throughput that has a very high efficiency and whatever you throw at it is going to process it fast and of course carefully picking what you throw at them and the sequence that you throw at them is part of having the team efficient. When you focus on that part I think everything takes its own way. Very well said. Should we do a recap of our 10 ways to be more effective?

**Thanasis** [00:39:07]: Yeah, I'm done.

**Dimitri** [00:39:08]: I'm sorry, did I interrupt? I'm sorry. I just saw the void and went in there to fill it. Very well said though about the throughput to be honest. Great measure too. It kind of makes the deadlines irrelevant, doesn't it? So maybe deadlines should just be for these type of operations, completely externally assigned.

**Thanasis** [00:39:44]: Yeah in Agile methodology there is no concept of deadline.

**Dimitri** [00:39:51]: Well you know sprint ends and stuff. But even that it's like arbitrary saying if you have a two week sprint and some of your tasks might get pushed over the next one. So it is about measuring efficiency.

**Thanasis** [00:40:05]: Ultimately the sprint is not a contract, right? It is just a sensible way to start to measure to gauge efficiency.

**Dimitri** [00:40:13]: Absolutely.

**Thanasis** [00:40:14]: And that's what you're doing with all the points that you're putting in. You know the estimation that you're doing, the planning, the assignments, the sprints, that's what it is bottom line. If you miss a task in a sprint it's not a big deal.

**Dimitri** [00:40:30]: No it's not and you know if you go back to the scrum, It's like a sprint review retrospective goes the next sprint and time is built to manage that workflow. So what can you do? I'll just read through the list. Have a routine, start each day on time, keep distractions at a minimum. Careful how you juggle your task, one task at a time. Responsible about the amount of pressure that you're applying to yourself and your team. Set realistic expectations, but you know add some safety margins on the site. Number six, proper channels of communication task assignment by reporting. Number Seven, never wait to last minute to bring something up. Number 8, communicate progress every day with stand ups. Having motivational and accountability mechanisms in place. Number nine, take care of yourself, eat, rest, body and soul and number 10, share your bad news.

**Dimitri** [00:41:53]: And with that, another episode came to the end.
