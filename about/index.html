    We started the Listen Ship Repeat podcast because we saw a lack of understanding and appreciation for the challenges posed on the actual "building" part of a Startup. Having 20+ years of experience, each, working with startups, we are starting to see patterns and specific paths that can be followed on each occasion, stage and situation a startup finds itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    In each episode we select a big challenge every startup will or has faced at some point and dive deep into it, providing simple digestible advice on how to navigate through these treacherous waters.
